      <description>This post will wrap up the function hooking series. You can view the previous posts here:
Function Hooking Part 1 - Test Program Function Hooking Part 2 - Password Safe In this post I will show another method you can use to hook functions. Instead of writing an injector and DLL in C++, I will be using a tool called Frida that allows you to do the same with Python and JavaScript.</description>

      <description>In this post I will expand on the information from my first post, Function Hooking Part 1 - Test Program. Previously, I discussed hooking a function from a custom application, in this post I will be hooking a function in the open-source password manager Password Safe.
As you can image, password managers are valuable targets during red team engaments since they contain additional credentials for other services or computers. If the main password to open the database is known or obtained, then all of the other credentials in the database are compromised.</description>
