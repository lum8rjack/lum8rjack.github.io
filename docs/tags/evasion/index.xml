      <description>While creating payload for different pen testing and red team projects, I would always run into having to bypass AV/EDRs. Once bypassed, the code and techniques would work for a few weeks or months before getting flagged as malicious. There has been a lot of research and blogs on different bypass techniques, but one that caught my eye mentioned file entropy. I have looked the entropy of firmware before to help determine if it was encrypted or not, but I have never looked at entropy when it came to C2 payloads.</description>
