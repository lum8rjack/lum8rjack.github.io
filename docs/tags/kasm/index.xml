      <description>Have you ever successfully phished a target during a red team engagement and received access to one of their online accounts? There are times you need to keep your browser session active after bypassing MFA so you aren&amp;rsquo;t logged out. You might have to leave your computer on for multiple days or if you are using a VPN, hope that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t disconnect. If multiple team members are on the project, it also makes it difficult to distribute the work if everyone is working remote and on their own machines.</description>
