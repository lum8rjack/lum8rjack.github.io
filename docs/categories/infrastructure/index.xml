      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever successfully phished a target during a red team engagement and received access to one of their online accounts? There are times you need to keep your browser session active after bypassing MFA so you aren&amp;rsquo;t logged out. You might have to leave your computer on for multiple days or if you are using a VPN, hope that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t disconnect. If multiple team members are on the project, it also makes it difficult to distribute the work if everyone is working remote and on their own machines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>C2 Redirectors Made Easy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In penetration testing and red teaming campaigns, Command-and-Control (C2) servers are used to simulate the control infrastructure that an attacker might use. These servers facilitate communication between the simulated malicious actors and the compromised systems. Using a proxy server, also known as a redirector, in front of a C2 server serves several important purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obscure the actual location of the C2 server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow only legitimate C2 traffic to reach the C2 server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the traffic is detected and blocked, the proxy can easily be destroyed and a new one deployed in it&amp;rsquo;s place. This is easier than re-deploying the C2 server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While deploying a redirector is relatively easy, one of the slow aspects is configuring the proxy rules to only allow legitimate C2 traffic to the C2 server. This involves reviewing the C2 profile and adding redirect rules to the proxy configuration file based on the User-Agent and each of the http endpoints. Any time the C2 profile updates any of the routes, you would also need to manually update the proxy configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
