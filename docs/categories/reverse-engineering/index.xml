      <description>The following post goes through the steps I took to reverse engineer different binaries in routers with the goal of decrypting an encoded password.
I recently switched internet providers and was given a new modem/router. When the technician came to setup my service, the device was already configured and just needed plugged in. I was planning on switching out the device with my old router, since I already had firewall rules and static routes configured, however when I logged into the new device I noticed it was configured to use PPoE to connect to the ISP.</description>
