      <description>&lt;p&gt;Phishing is still one of the common methods threat actors utilize to breach companies. Most phishing attacks try tricking the victim into revealing sensitive information or downloading and executing malicious attachments and files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During many of the phishing engagements I have performed, I tend to target organizationâ€™s identity and access management services. Okta is one common service that is widely used across the industry and, if compromised, can provide access to many other services in the organization. While Okta and other
services tend to have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled, users can still be compromised despite this protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
