I have been in cyber security for about 8 years performing a variety of technical assessments. These assements include penetration testing, web application testing, and performing red and purple team engagements. After reading countless blogs on different techniques and open source tools, I figured I would start posting research and scripts that I have created that have helped me out. 

Certifications:
- Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
- Web Application Penetration Tester Extreme (eWPTX)
- GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN)
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
- Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP)
